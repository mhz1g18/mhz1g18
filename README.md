Hello, I am Milko Zlatev  
  
I study Computer Science at the University of Southampton,  
and am expected to get my Bachelor's Degree in July 2021  
  
 I am interested in algorithms and full-stack development.
 
 Technologies I am familiar include
 - TypeScript and JavaScript
 - Node.JS
 - React, AngularJS, React Native
- Java and Spring Boot
 - Python

Currently I am interested in perfecting React skills,  
as well as exploring serverless architectures. Right now  
I am using React and Firebase. I think the provide a  
wonderful developer experience.
